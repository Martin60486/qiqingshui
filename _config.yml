baseurl: "" # Leave empty if deploying to the root of a custom domain: www.expaccounting.ca. 
# This ensures that all site files appear as if they are served from the root
# of your custom domain, not from a subdirectory like /EXP.
url: "https://martin60486.github.io/#EXP" # true domain at github pages

#CNAME Record:
#You added a CNAME record in GoDaddy that maps www.expaccounting.ca to martin60486.github.io. 
#This tells browsers that requests for your custom domain should be resolved to GitHub Pages.

#GitHub Pages Settings:
#You configured your GitHub Pages repository to recognize and serve your site under 
#www.expaccounting.ca. The CNAME file in your repository ensures GitHub knows your custom 
# domain is linked to the repository.

#Outcome:
# When someone visits www.expaccounting.ca, the DNS resolves to martin60486.github.io/EXP, 
# but GitHub serves the content as if it's from the root of www.expaccounting.ca. 
# Thanks to the _config.yml setup (baseurl: ""), the site behaves correctly without showing /EXP in the URLs.
